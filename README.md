# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
This project was created as a way for me to begin learning fundamental skills for web development. The process consisted of learning introductory elements in HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, and Markdown writing styles. By creating the webpage and storing notes I was able to record my progress and create a webpage that could provide insight to other beginners. Creating this project has given me more confidence in my own ability to understand to various uses for different types of code. Creating my first webpage has inspired a curiousity to explore further and develop more webpages!
